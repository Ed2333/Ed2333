</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Broken Pencils Initiative</h1>
  
  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>At the Broken Pencils Initiative, we envision a world where every child, regardless of their circumstances, has the opportunity to shape a promising future through education. We strive to eliminate early child marriage and create an environment that fosters empowerment, equality, and educational access.</p>
  
  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is twofold: to prevent and eradicate early child marriage and to provide educational opportunities to vulnerable children, particularly girls, in deprived rural areas. We believe that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and empowering individuals to reach their full potential.</p>
  
  <h2>Background and Context</h2>
  <p>In many deprived rural communities, early child marriage continues to be a pressing issue, hindering children, especially girls, from accessing education and realizing their dreams. Poverty, cultural norms, and limited resources contribute to the perpetuation of this harmful practice. The Broken Pencils Initiative aims to address these challenges head-on.</p>
